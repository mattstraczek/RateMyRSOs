## Project Summary

This project intends to build a review website, RateMyRSOs, that allows students at UIUC to post reviews and
ratings to UIUCâ€™s Registered Student Organizations (RSOs). RateMyRSOs would resemble the functionalities
of RateMyProfessors, a popular website for professor and college ratings, but focused on sharing the reviews
and ratings for RSOs at UIUC instead.
